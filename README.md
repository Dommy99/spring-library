## Description
Resister if you are new or login if you are coming back! Create, update, list all(or by id) and delete books to help maintain your own personal library.
## Approach
I started with heavy planing for the first couple hours. I made the ERD diagram, user stories, made a board of steps that I could check off, and reviewed my plan/design with a partner.
Then I focused on the model/tables and the relationship between them following the ERD diagram that I made. Planning was key for a project like this because of all the moving parts. Next was 
making sure the API end points had full CRUD(create, read,update, and delete) functionality. When that was completed I worked on security making some end point private and some public depending on the needs.

Pushing often, keeping to DRY and KISS approaches to code were my main priorities. Taking advantage of feature branches and making docstrings to keep track of code really helped.

## ToolsAndTech
- Springboot
- JPA repository
- Json Web Tokens
- Postgresql
## User-Story
- As a user, I should be able to login or register.
- As a user, I should be able to create, update, list all(or by id) and delete books.
- As a user, I should not be able to create, update, list all(or by id) and delete books if I'm not logged.
- As a user, I should be shown a message when I win, lose or tie.
